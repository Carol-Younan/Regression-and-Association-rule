# Regression and Association rule

This repository contains various machine learning implementations using Jupyter Notebooks. Each notebook demonstrates a different machine learning algorithm with explanations and code.

## Contents

1. **Association Rule Mining (assosication\_rule.ipynb)**

   - Implements association rule mining for discovering interesting relationships between variables in large datasets.
   - Uses algorithms like Apriori or FP-Growth.
   - Evaluates rules based on support, confidence, and lift.

2. **Implementation.ipynb**

   - General implementation to linear regression
   - Include model training, and evaluation

3. **KNN Regression (KNN\_regression.ipynb)**

   - Implements the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) regression algorithm.
   - Explains distance metrics, choosing optimal k, and handling overfitting.
   - Evaluates performance using RMSE, MAE, or R-squared metrics.

4. **Linear Regression (LinearRegression.ipynb)**

   - Implements simple and multiple linear regression models.
   - Covers gradient descent and normal equation methods.
   - Analyzes model performance using statistical metrics.
